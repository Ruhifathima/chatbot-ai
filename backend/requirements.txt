Fact: The first powered flight was achieved by the Wright brothers on December 17, 1903.

Airplane Parts: The main parts of an aircraft include the fuselage, wings, engines, landing gear, and tail.

Aerodynamics: Aircraft fly due to the four forces acting on them: lift, weight, thrust, and drag.

Runways: Runway numbers indicate their compass heading, rounded to the nearest 10 degrees.

Air Traffic Control: ATC manages aircraft movement to prevent collisions and ensure smooth operations.

Cabin Pressure: Aircraft cabins are pressurized to maintain safe oxygen levels at high altitudes.

Jet Engines: Jet engines work by compressing air, mixing it with fuel, and igniting it to produce thrust.

Black Box: The black box records flight data and cockpit conversations to help in crash investigations.

Commercial Aircraft: The Boeing 747, known as the "Jumbo Jet," revolutionized long-haul air travel.

Supersonic Flight: Concorde was a supersonic passenger jet that flew faster than the speed of sound.

Flight Altitudes: Commercial aircraft typically cruise at altitudes between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.

Weather Impact: Strong winds, lightning, and turbulence can affect flight safety and efficiency.

Autopilot: Modern aircraft use autopilot systems to assist pilots in long-haul flights.

Airport Codes: Every airport has a unique three-letter IATA code, such as LAX for Los Angeles.

Largest Plane: The Antonov An-225 "Mriya" was the world's largest cargo aircraft before it was destroyed in 2022.
